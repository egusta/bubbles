Local Persistence: Remembers seen topics, blocked channels, and your personal likes using LocalStorage.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Vanilla JavaScript.

AI/Backend (Proxy): * Images: Pollinations.ai (Flux Model).

Text Generation: Pollinations.ai (OpenAI/Gemini/Perplexity models).

Serverless Backend (Optional): Cloudflare Workers + Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) for the global like counter.

🛠️ Setup Guide

1. Local / Static Hosting (Quick Start)

You can run BubbleUp directly in any browser without a backend server (Likes will be mocked).

Clone this repository.

Open index.html in your browser.

Done! The app will work immediately. The "Like" count will be simulated locally.

2. Enabling Global Likes (Cloudflare Setup)

To make the "Like" counter real and global for all users, you need to deploy the backend worker.

Prerequisites:

A free Cloudflare account.

Step A: Create the Database

Log in to the Cloudflare Dashboard.

Navigate to Storage & Databases > D1.

Create a new database named trivia-db.

In the Console tab of your new database, run this SQL:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS likes (topic_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, count INTEGER DEFAULT 0);


Step B: Deploy the Worker

Navigate to Compute (Workers).

Create a new Worker (e.g., bubbleup-likes).

Paste the code from worker.js (found in this repo or generated previously) into the online editor.

Go to Settings > Variables and Secrets > D1 Database Bindings.

Add a binding variable named DB and connect it to your trivia-db.

Deploy the worker.

Step C: Connect Frontend

Copy your Worker's URL (e.g., https://bubbleup-likes.yourname.workers.dev).

Open index.html.

Find the line const API_URL = "";.

Paste your URL: const API_URL = "https://bubbleup-likes.yourname.workers.dev";.

Save and host index.html anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
